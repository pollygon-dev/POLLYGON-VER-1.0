        <p>'Ephemeral' is a Twine game I created for one of my classes. My assignment was to create a short story about two characters that I've created!</p>

					<h2>Jurius</h2>
					<P>He/Him | 25 | Human; Half-Sakrid</P>
					<p>Because of his upbringing, Jurius is extremely
                        introverted and tends not to talk to new people and
                        appears cold. While his expressions do not show how he
                        feels, Jurius is an extremely emotional person and is
                        extremely sympathetic towards those who suffer and
                        try to help them. He is also idealistic, as he always
                        imagined and dreamt of leaving Everwatch and explore
                        Veldren. He is sometimes intuitive, doing some things
                        on impulse, such as him escaping the village to make
                        time for himself.</p>

                    <h2>Allister</h2>
                    <P>He/Him | 25 | Illuna</P>
                    <p>Allister appears to be the complete opposite of Jurius,
                        he is very energetic and friendly to everyone he meets.
                        Because he is from a family of merchants, Allister had to
                        learn how to become amicable with everyone no matter
                        how he feels about someone. Apart from tending their
                        family's shop, he loves to go out to the woods to pick up
                        herbs that he then uses for alchemy. Allister is also a
                        very skilled alchemist, even having his own spot in their
                        shop for goods he makes by doing this hobby.</p>

        <p>You can play it by clicking this link: <a href="Ephemeral.html" target="_blank" class="link">Click here</a></p>
        <p>This is a fairly short story I made as a requirement for one of my classes. The story is very rushed, but I still hope you'll have fun reading through it, just as I enjoyed bringing these two to life!</p>
        <h1>Plans / Updates</h1>
        <p>I plan to turn this into a visual novel for people to better visualize the setting and worldbuilding of the world of my OCs, but maybe after I finish an ongoing project. Stay tuned, though!</p>
