    <title>POLLYGON VER. 2.0!</title>
            <description>Hey there! Said goodbye to my retro layout and decided to try a new one, so here's POLLYGON 2.0! it's fully mobile-responsive unlike its predecessor (though the content is not mobile-responsive atm..) and will have some apps like Paint and possibly more soon. :)
        
        Currently working on making mobile-friendly pages on my layout so I'll go back to coding OTL
        
        Really like how it turned out!</description>
