                        <p>Courier’s younger brother. Ever since he was a child, he has always been reserved and gentle with his words - the exact opposite of his older sister, which is why most people find him boring and distant. He works as an advisor for a noble family.
                            <br><br>
                            Due to the curse that struck both him and Courier, his physical condition kept deteriorating until it never fully recovered. Because of this, Courier has made him a golem to help him move around.</p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Julian is a remarkably gentle and reserved individual, whose quiet demeanor often leads others to perceive him as distant or uninteresting. Despite these misconceptions, he possesses a sharp and analytical mind that serves him well in his role as an advisor to a noble family. His current state is marked by a devastating curse - the price of his sister's desperate decision to bring him back from death, which has left his body in a constant state of deterioration. This condition, requiring the use of a golem for mobility, has only reinforced his tendency to rely on careful thought and measured words rather than direct action. <br> <br>
                            Unlike his sister Courier's fiery temperament, Julian approaches situations with patience and careful consideration. This stark contrast with his sister's personality, however, doesn't diminish their close bond - if anything, their differences complement each other perfectly. The fact that his sister broke the sacred taboo of resurrection to save him speaks volumes about their relationship, even though it came at a terrible cost. While he may appear withdrawn to strangers, those who know him well understand that his gentle nature comes from a place of genuine kindness rather than weakness.<br> <br>
                            Even with his body's continuous deterioration due to the curse, Julian maintains his dignity and independence through his intellectual contributions. His reserved nature allows him to observe and understand situations deeply, making him particularly valuable as an advisor. Though some might mistake his quietness for timidity, Julian possesses an inner strength that shows itself in his persistence despite his curse and his compassionate understanding of his sister's fateful choice to save him, regardless of the consequences.<br> <br>

                        <p>Julian Cross is the younger brother of Courier, born in a small town between Stillmoor and Filenore. Following a devastating monster attack that claimed their parents' lives when Julian was just an infant, he and his sister found refuge among the elves of Stillmoor. While Lilian excelled in magic, Julian's body proved too weak to channel magical energy, leading him to develop his mind instead. Though quiet and reserved compared to his fiery sister, the siblings remained inseparable throughout their childhood, with Lilian raising and fiercely protecting him. <br> <br>
                            Currently serving as an advisor to a noble family, Julian's life took a darker turn when a fatal incident led his sister to break the ultimate taboo by reviving him from death. This act cursed him with a continuously deteriorating body, forcing him to rely on a golem crafted by his sister for mobility. Despite these hardships, he maintains his gentle demeanor and sharp intellect, finding purpose in his advisory role despite his physical limitations. <br> <br></p>

                            "Each day my body fails me is another day my sister blames herself. If only she could see that her love, even in breaking that sacred taboo, was the greatest gift I could have received."

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Early Life</h2>
                        <p>Julian Cross was born in a small town between Stillmoor and Filenore, where he lived with his older sister Lilian and their parents in a modest cottage. His early life was marked by tragedy when, as an infant, their town was devastated by a massive monster attack that claimed both his parents' lives – his father falling in combat against the horde, and his mother sacrificing herself to ensure her children's escape. 
                            <br><br>
                            Though too young to remember these events himself, Julian and his sister found refuge among the elves of Stillmoor, who recognized them as the children of Lorenna, a former member of their community. Unlike his sister who inherited their parents' extraordinary magical aptitude, Julian's body proved too weak to properly channel magical energy. This inherent limitation, combined with the discrimination they faced as "half" elves, shaped him into a reserved and gentle-spoken individual, markedly different from his more temperamental sister. Despite their contrasting personalities, Julian and Lilian were inseparable throughout their childhood, with his sister essentially raising him after the loss of their parents. Lilian was fiercely protective of her younger brother, going to any lengths to cheer him up whenever he felt down – a testament to their unbreakable bond.  
                            <br><br>
                            While Lilian excelled in the elves' teachings of healing magic and flora control, Julian had to find different paths to contribute, developing a sharp mind that would later serve him well as an advisor.</p>
