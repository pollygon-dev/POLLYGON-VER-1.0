                        <h2 class="section-title">Character Overview</h2>
                        <p>A traveling water mage with long hair and a stoic demeanor, Noah hails from a remote town far from others. His isolated upbringing led to a blunt and somewhat rough way of speaking, though he's actually an excellent listener when others talk. Despite his expertise in magic, he has a notably poor sense of direction - a weakness that forces him to spend much of his time studying maps and navigation, though with limited success.  <br><br>
                            Noah traveled alongside his companion Abel, whose chance intervention during a mishap with thieves led to their partnership. Their opposing personalities - Noah's cautious pragmatism against Abel's heroic altruism - formed an unexpectedly perfect dynamic. While Noah appeared aloof and spoke roughly to most people, he showed a notably softer side with Abel. <br><br>
                            An interesting contrast in his character is how he can be simultaneously direct with his words yet guarded with his feelings. He has a fascinating hobby of collecting antiques, making it a point to purchase one in every town he visits. Though he'd prefer to avoid trouble by ignoring those in need, he found himself drawn into helping others through Abel's influence.</p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Noah presents himself as aloof and detached, speaking bluntly and sometimes harshly to others - a result of his isolated upbringing. However, this exterior masks a more complex personality. While he can seem cold and uncaring, he's actually an excellent listener who pays careful attention to others, even if his responses might not show it. <br> <br>
                            Despite his capable nature as a mage, Noah has an endearing flaw in his poor sense of direction, which often forces him to interact with others when he'd rather not. He's pragmatic and cautious by nature, preferring to avoid trouble rather than seek it out, which often put him at odds with Abel's more heroic tendencies.<br> <br>
                            One of Noah's most distinctive traits is the duality in his character - he's direct and unfiltered with his words, yet extremely guarded with his emotions. This creates an interesting contrast where he can speak harsh truths easily but struggles to express genuine feelings. He has a hidden talent for acting, allowing him to maintain his stoic facade even when his emotions run deep.<br> <br>
                            His passion for collecting antiques reveals a more sensitive side to his personality, showing an appreciation for history and the stories objects can tell. While he maintains his rough manner of speaking with most people, he notably softens his approach with those he truly cares about, though such instances are rare.<br> <br>

                        <h2 class="section-title">Noah and Abel</h2>
                        <p>
                            It all started with a bar fight, of all things. Noah, lost and struggling with directions as usual, had managed to offend some local thieves with his characteristic bluntness while asking for help. It could have ended badly if Abel hadn't stepped in. Noah, never one to leave a debt unpaid, insisted on buying his savior a drink. He didn't expect that single drink would turn Abel into such a rowdy drunk, or that he'd end up spending the whole night making sure this strange, kind man didn't get himself into trouble. Looking back, maybe that night perfectly captured who they both were - Noah's reluctant care-taking and Abel's boundless, if sometimes reckless, kindness. <br><br>
                            
                            Those contrasts between them should have made friendship impossible. Noah approached everything with caution and practicality, while Abel would dive headfirst into helping others without a second thought. But somehow, it worked. Noah found himself speaking more softly around Abel, something he'd never done with anyone else. And Abel, for all his impulsive heroics, seemed to understand Noah's need for space and quiet. <br><br>
                            
                            Their five years of traveling together were filled with small moments that meant everything. Abel had this habit of braiding Noah's hair when he thought he was asleep, and he'd spend hours in libraries telling Noah about stories he'd read. He'd drag Noah into antique shops in every town, always watching Noah's reactions to see what caught his eye. These quiet gestures said more than words ever could.<br><br>
                            
                            They didn't always agree, especially when it came to helping others. Noah would try to avoid trouble, seeing no reason to risk themselves for strangers. Abel couldn't walk past someone in need without stopping. They'd argue about it, sometimes heatedly, but they always found their way back to understanding. Maybe that's what made their partnership work - they challenged each other, made each other see the world differently.<br><br>
                            
                            Neither of them ever said the words out loud. Noah kept his feelings locked away, too afraid of losing what they had. Abel spoke through actions instead - like the compass he bought, the one Noah had wanted for so long but never got to receive. Sometimes the things that matter most go unsaid until it's too late.<br><br>
                            
                            Five years might not seem like much, but it was enough to change them both completely. Abel taught Noah that it was okay to show gentleness, while Noah's cautious nature probably saved them from more than a few disasters. They were an unlikely pair - the blunt, lost mage and the kind-hearted hero - but together they found something rare and true, even if it ended too soon.</p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
                        <p>
                            Noah grew up in a highly isolated town where he learned to practice magic, specializing in water-based spells. The town's extreme remoteness from other settlements meant visitors were rare, leading to Noah developing a very direct and sometimes unintentionally harsh way of speaking. Despite being a talented mage, he struggled with basic navigation, often getting lost despite his magical abilities. <br> <br>
                            
                            His journey began when he finally left his hometown, though his blunt way of speaking quickly got him into trouble. Despite being a talented water mage, Noah struggled constantly with navigation, spending countless hours studying maps yet still frequently getting lost. It was during one such moment, while asking for directions in a town, that he unintentionally offended a group of people who turned out to be thieves. This incident could have ended badly if not for Abel's intervention, which led to Noah reluctantly accepting help and offering to repay the debt. <br> <br>
                            
                            What started as a simple gesture of repayment evolved into a five-year journey together. Despite their opposing views - Noah's preference to avoid trouble versus Abel's drive to help others in need - they formed an unlikely but strong partnership. Over time, Noah began to show more of his softer side, though only to Abel. His habit of collecting antiques gave them excuses to explore various shops in every town they visited, with Noah particularly drawn to an old compass he couldn't yet afford. <br> <br>
                            
                            Throughout their travels, Noah developed his magical abilities while also learning to better interact with others, though he remained notably more pleasant with Abel than with anyone else. Despite growing feelings for his companion, Noah kept them hidden, unwilling to risk changing their comfortable dynamic. He found ways to express his care through actions rather than words, using his talent for acting to maintain his usual demeanor even as his feelings grew deeper.<br> <br>
                            
                            Noah continues his travels today, using his water magic and growing social understanding to navigate both the physical and emotional landscapes before him. Though still direct in his speech with others, he's learned to balance his natural aloofness with the ability to listen and understand, a skill that makes him more approachable than his initial impression might suggest. <br> <br></p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h2 class="section-title">Early Life</h2>
                        <p>Born in a remote town far from other settlements, Noah grew up in an environment where visitors were rare and interaction with outsiders was minimal. It was here that he learned to practice water magic, developing his abilities despite the limited resources and guidance available. The town's isolation shaped not only his magic but also his way of communicating - direct and unfiltered, as was common among his community. <br> <br>
                            Despite being a talented mage, Noah developed a notably poor sense of direction, perhaps due to his town's isolation and limited opportunities for travel in his youth. This weakness would ironically become a defining trait of the future traveler. During his early years, he discovered a fascination with antiques, finding interest in objects that carried stories of the outside world he rarely got to see. <br> <br>
                            His upbringing in this secluded environment meant he never learned the social niceties common in other places. When he finally left his hometown to travel, this direct way of speaking often led to misunderstandings with others, though his excellent listening skills and surprising talent for acting helped him navigate some social situations. It wasn't until meeting Abel that he began to understand there were different ways to interact with people, though he chose to maintain his blunt manner with most while reserving a gentler way of speaking for his closest companion. </p>

                                <p>Noah's traveling companion of five years, who saved him from thieves after his blunt way of speaking got him into trouble. Despite their contrasting personalities - Abel's heroic altruism against Noah's pragmatic caution - they formed an unexpectedly perfect partnership. Noah speaks notably softer with Abel than with others, showing a rare gentler side of himself. Though he harbors deep feelings for Abel, he keeps them hidden to preserve their friendship, choosing instead to express his care through subtle actions. Their main source of conflict comes from their different approaches to helping others, with Noah preferring to avoid trouble while Abel rushes to aid those in need.</p>

She continues to offer Noah comfort and understanding even after her grandson's passing.</p>
