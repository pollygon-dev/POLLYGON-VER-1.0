                       Ooe (大穢) is a Murder Mystery BL Visual Novel made by ADELTA. Its completed version was released on April 19, 2025. <br> <br>
                        The story follows detective Oosaki, who receives a request to attend a memorial ceremony on someone's behalf on the remote island of Ooejima, located beyond Hachijoujima, south of Tokyo. The ceremony commemorates the second anniversary of actress An Ooe's death. <br> <br>  However, things quickly go wrong when the ship meant to bring the attendees back fails to appear, the event coordinator goes missing, and an atmosphere of fear and hatred emerges among the ten attendees. <br> <br>
                       The situation deteriorates further when the servant who had been helping them is found dead, only to be followed by a second and third crime. While stranded, the attendees must work together to unravel the mystery connecting them.

He is considered the supreme authority on burns treatment in the country due to his skills. Has made many people regain a sense of beauty thanks to his delicate sensitivity. He has a very stern face, but he’s a gentle man deep down. He even gives a generous laugh whenever he sees young people being impolite.</p>
                                <p>He is the doctor who attended An Ooe’s deathbed and regrets his inability to help her at the time.</p>

                                <p>Your suspect.</p>
                                <p>A hired servant who runs two abandoned inns on Ooejima, the Crescent Moon and the Yaegaki. He is in charge of taking care of the meals for the attendees, making the preparations for the memorial service and all rituals carried on the island. He leaves nothing undone and is often seen running around as he’s very busy. He is usually laid-back and the purity of his heart is such that even the island’s butterflies are fond of him. …For some reason, he only fears Oosaki. </p>

                                <p>Priest at Nisshuji, a small temple in Ibaraki. Affiliated with the True Pure Land sect of Buddhism. He is soft-spoken and his gestures are delicate. There is always a gentle air about him. He was invited to this memorial service as a monk, but has never interacted with the Ooe family so what ties him to the family remains unknown. He decided to come to the island in order to ascertain the true intentions of the event’s coordinator.</p>

                                <p>Someone you have to protect.</p>
                                <p>A boy who came on behalf of his mother. Has some sort of mental illness and cannot express himself clearly. Sometimes, his legs stop working all of a sudden. He weighs heavily on Oosaki’s mind. What’s more, he doesn’t even know what kind of person An Ooe was. He tends to be in low spirits when he thinks about life on the deserted island, which is being increasingly driven to extreme poverty, but he doesn’t blame anyone for it.</p>

                                <p>His dad’s dying wishes, which were to look for ‘someone who looks just like Shizuma’ and to ‘have someone else go to the memorial service’, led him to Oosaki. He is quite sensible when they first meet, but gradually his cunning side begins to show.</p>
